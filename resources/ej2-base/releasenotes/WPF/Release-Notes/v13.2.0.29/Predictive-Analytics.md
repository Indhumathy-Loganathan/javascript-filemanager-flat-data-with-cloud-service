## Predictive Analytics

### Feature

* PMML stands for Predictive Model Markup Language. It is an XML-based file format developed by the Data Mining Group, to provide a way for applications to describe and exchange models produced by data mining and machine learning algorithms. The Syncfusion PMML Execution engine directly score (interpret) the models based on PMML, against inputs and provides output values.

* Score inputs and provides output values.The results match the results obtained from R.Predicts both classification (Categorical values) as well as regression (Numeric values).Calculates the probability of prediction in case of categorical output.

* Provided support for Spark PMML models

* Now PMML Execution Engine extends its support for the following models

* Association Rules Model

* Gradient Boosting Model
