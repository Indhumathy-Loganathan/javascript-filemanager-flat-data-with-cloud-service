### Breaking Changes
{:#sfscheduler-breaking-changes}

* In the previous, if the monthly recurrence rule is added for the 31st day, an appointment is added on the last day of the month if the 31st date is not availed (Feb, Apr, Jun, Sep, Nov). But, now the occurrence is only added for the months that have the 31st date.

* The `ByDay` support is removed from the daily recurrence type, but the same support is applicable in the weekly recurrence rule type.
