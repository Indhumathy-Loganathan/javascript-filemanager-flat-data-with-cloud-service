## TileView

### Bug Fixes
{:#TileView-bug-fixes}

* \#I325259 - When virtualization is enabled, Tileview items will be displayed properly when no value is assigned for `RowCount` and `ColumnCount`. Now, the maximized TileView item will render properly without unnecessary spacings when virtualization is enabled and application is resized. Now, size of all the minimized TileView items will be same when virtualization is enabled.
