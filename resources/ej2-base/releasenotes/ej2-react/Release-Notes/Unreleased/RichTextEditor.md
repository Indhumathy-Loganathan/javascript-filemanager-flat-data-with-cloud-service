## RichTextEditor

### Bug Fixes

- `#I522154` - Now, `maxLength` property is calculated properly when pasting the content into the Rich Text Editor.
- `#I526413` - Now, the `imageRemoving` event exposes the correct arguments in the Rich Text Editor.

### Breaking Changes

- Now, the shortcut key to open the Insert video dialog has been changed to <kbd>CTRL+ALT+V </kbd> from <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+V</kbd> to ensure that the Paste as plain text browser shortcut works properly.
