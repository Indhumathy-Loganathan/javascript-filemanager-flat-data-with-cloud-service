## 3DChart

A 3D chart is a graphical representation of data in three dimensions, showcasing relationships and trends among variables. Unlike traditional 2D charts, 3D charts add depth to the visualization, allowing for a more immersive and comprehensive understanding of data patterns.


- **Series** - The chart can plot over six chart types, including column, bar, stacking column, stacking bar, 100% stacked column, and 100% stacked bar.
- **Data Binding** - Bind the 3D chart component with an array of JSON objects or a DataManager. In addition to chart series, data labels, and tooltips can also be bound to your data.
- **Data Labels** - Support data labels to annotate points with labels to improve the readability of data.
- **Axis Types** - Able to plot different data types such as numbers, datetime, logarithmic, and string.
- **Axis Features** - Supports multiple axes, inverted axes, multiple panes, opposed positions, and smart labels.
- **Legend** - Supports a legend to provide additional information about a series with customization options.
- **Animation** - Chart series will be animated when rendering and refreshing the chart widget.
- **User Interaction** - Supports interactive features such as tooltips and data point selection.
- **Export** - Supports printing the 3D chart directly from the browser and exporting the chart in both JPEG and PNG formats.
- **RTL Support** - Provides a full-fledged right-to-left mode that aligns the axis, tooltip, legend, and data in the 3D chart component from right to left.
- **Appearance** - Colors for the 3D charts are picked by the built-in theme, but each element of the 3D chart can be customized with simple configuration options.
- **Accessibility** - Designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, with features such as WAI-ARIA standard compliance and keyboard navigation to ensure that the 3D chart can be effectively used with assistive technologies such as screen readers.
