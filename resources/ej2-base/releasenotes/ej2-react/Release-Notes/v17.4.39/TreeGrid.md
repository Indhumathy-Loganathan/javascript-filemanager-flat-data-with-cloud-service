## TreeGrid

### Features

- AutoFill support has been provided that allows users to copy the data of selected cells and paste it to another cells by dragging.

### Breaking Changes

- Default value of column's `disableHtmlEncode` is set to true, so the HTML tags can be displayed in the Grid header and content by default. To display it as html content `disableHtmlEncode` need to be set as false.
