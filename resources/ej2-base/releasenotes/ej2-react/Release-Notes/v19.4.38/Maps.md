## Maps

### Bug Fixes

- `#F163990` - When the `imageUrlValuePath` property is set as the source image for the markers, image type markers will render properly.

### Features

- GeoJSON maps with "LineString" geometry type is now supported in the Maps control.
- When the `animationDuration` property is set, the zooming of map service providers such as OSM, Bing, and others is now smoother.
