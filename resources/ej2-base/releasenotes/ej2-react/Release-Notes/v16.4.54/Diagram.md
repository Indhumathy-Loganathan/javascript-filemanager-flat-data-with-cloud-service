### Bug Fixes

- Z-order maintained properly now when adding the nodes at runtime.
- Port dragging now working properly after rotating the nodes.
- When dragging the port, connectors associated with the ports updated properly.
- If anyone of the selected nodes doesnâ€™t have rotate constraints, rotate handle no longer visible with the selection handles.
