## Maps

### Bug Fixes

- `#SF-360297` - The position of the marker template will now be proper when the float CSS style is set as "right" in the parent element of the Maps control.

### Features

- When the `type` property of `legendSettings` property is set to "Markers", the `useMarkerShapes` property is exposed in the `legendSettings` to render the legend item shapes the same as the marker shapes.
