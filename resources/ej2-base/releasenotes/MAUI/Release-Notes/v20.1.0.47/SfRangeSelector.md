The .NET MAUI Range Selector (SfRangeSelector) is a highly interactive UI control for selecting a smaller numeric range from a larger data set. It provides a rich set of features such as labels, ticks, dividers, step sizes, overlays, and tooltips. It also supports adding any type of control as its content.

### Key features
{:#range-selector-key-features}

* **Child support**: Add a child of any type inside the Range Selector. It is also possible to add the [Charts](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/getting-started) control in it. The Range Selector is smart enough to handle functions like segment selection and chart zooming based on the range specified in it.
* **Labels**: Render labels for the numeric values and customize their formats based on your requirements.
* **Ticks and dividers**: Show ticks and dividers based on specified intervals. Minor ticks can also be enabled to show the values between intervals. These features display the selected value in a more intuitive way for end users.
* **Tooltips**: Render tooltips to show the selected range clearly. It is also possible to customize the format of the text shown in the tooltip.
* **Discrete selection**: Select only discrete values.
* **Thumb icon support**: Insert custom controls like an icon or text inside the left and right thumbs.
