* **Child support**: Add a child of any type inside the Range selector. It is also possible to add the [Charts](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/getting-started) control in it. The DateTime Range selector is smart enough to handle functions like segment selection and chart zooming based on the time range specified in it.
* **Labels**: Render labels for the date-time value with the option to customize their formats based on your requirements.
* **Ticks and dividers**: Provides the option to show ticks and dividers based on the specified interval. Minor ticks can also be enabled to show the values between intervals. These features display the selected value in a more intuitive way for end users.
* **Tooltips** - Render tooltips to show the selected range clearly. It is also possible to customize the format of the text shown in the tooltip.
* **Discrete selection**:  Select only discrete values.
* **Thumb icon support**: Insert custom controls like an icon or text inside the left and right thumbs.
