   * **Bubble :** It is a visually appealing way to represent data with multiple dimensions, as the size of the bubbles indicates an additional data dimension.
   * **Stacked Column :** It represents data values in a stacked column format, where the columns are stacked on top of each other to indicate the cumulative value of the data points.
   * **Waterfall :** It visually represents the cumulative effect of a set of positive and negative values.
   * **Box and Whisker :** It used to visualize datasets by summarizing their distribution and identifying potential outliers.
   * **Error Bar :** This series provides a graphical representation of the uncertainty associated with reported values, which helps to identify potential measurement deviations.
