* Type of `Value` API has been changed from `double` to `object`
* `SFNumericTextBoxDelegate` class has been removed along with the `Delegate` API of the control. Instead of this Delegate,   `ValueChanged` event has been implemented.[For migration please refer this [KB](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/7707/how-to-handle-events-in-sfnumerictextbox-for-xamarin-ios-platforms)]
