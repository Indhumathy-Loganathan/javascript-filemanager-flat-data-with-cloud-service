### Bug Fixes

- `#F163539` - The data labels will now render properly when the value of `labelPath` of `dataLabelSettings` is different from the value of `shapePropertyPath` and `shapeDataPath`.

### Features

- `#315251` - The `opacity` property for `border` in `shapeSettings` is exposed to provide opacity for the border of the shapes.
