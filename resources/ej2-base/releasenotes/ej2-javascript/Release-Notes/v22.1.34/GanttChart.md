## Gantt Chart

### Features

-`#I43435` - Improved the user interface of taskbar resizing and moving actions in the Gantt Chart. Now, when users perform taskbar resizing or moving, a virtual element is displayed instead of updating the original taskbar element. This virtual element remains visible until the action is completed, providing users with a clear representation of the changes they are making. Please find the demo link [here](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/demos/#/bootstrap5/gantt/editing.html).


### Breaking changes

- Connector lines have been changed from elements to SVG elements for UI improvement. This change has been made to enhance the user interface and provide a more visually appealing and flexible way of displaying connector lines.
