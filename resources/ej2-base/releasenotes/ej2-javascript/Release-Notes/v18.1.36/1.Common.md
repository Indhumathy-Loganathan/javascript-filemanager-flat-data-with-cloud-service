### Breaking Changes

The newly added `Dropdown Tree` component in dropdowns package requires `Navigations` dependency, so now it is mandatory to include the `ej2-navigations.umd.min.js` in `system.js` configuration if you are using the system.js module loader.
Update the system.js configuration while going with this version and above.
