## DropdownTree

- **Check boxes** - Select more than one item in the Dropdown Tree control without affecting the UI appearance.
- **Multiple selection** - Select more than one item in the control.
- **Sorting** - Display the Dropdown Tree items in ascending or descending order.
- **Template** - Customize the Dropdown Tree items, header, footer, action failure content, and no records content.
- **Accessibility** - Provide access to all the Dropdown Tree control features through keyboard interaction, on-screen readers, and other assistive technology devices.
