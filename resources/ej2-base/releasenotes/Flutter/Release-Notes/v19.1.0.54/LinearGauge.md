## LinearGauge `Beta`

The Flutter Linear Gauge is a data visualization widget that can be used to display data on a linear scale in either horizontal or vertical orientation.


### Key Features

* **Orientation** - The Linear Gauge can be set to vertical or horizontal orientation.

* **Axis** - The Linear Gauge axis is a scale where a set of values can be plotted. An axis can be customized by changing the thickness and edge styles. Users can also inverse the axis.

* **Labels and Ticks** -The Linear Gauge axis elements, such as labels, major ticks, and minor ticks, can be customized to different styles.

* **Ranges** - A range is a visual element that helps visualize where a range falls on the axis track quickly. Multiple ranges with different styles can be added to a linear gauge.

* **Pointers** - A pointer is used to indicate a specific value on an axis. The widget has three types of pointers: shape marker, widget marker, and bar. All the pointers can be customized as needed and multiple pointers can added to a linear gauge. 

* **Animation** - All linear gauge elements can be animated in a visually appealing way. It is possible to animate the gauge elements when they are loading or when their values change.

* **Pointer interaction** - The shape and widget marker pointers in a Linear Gauge can be moved from one value to another with swipe or drag gestures.
