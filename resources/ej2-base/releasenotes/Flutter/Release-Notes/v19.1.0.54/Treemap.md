## Treemap `Beta`

### Features

The Treemap is a data visualization widget that provides an effective way to visualize flat and hierarchical data as rectangles that are sized and colored based on quantitative variables.

* **Labels** - Add any type of widgets (like text widget) to improve the readability of the individual tiles by providing brief descriptions on labels.

* **Layouts** - Use different layouts based on the algorithms such as squarified, slice, and dice to represent flat and hierarchically structured data.

* **Colors** - Categorize the tiles on the treemap by customizing their color based on the levels. It is possible to set the tile color for a specific value or for a range of values.

* **Tooltip** - Display additional information about the tile using a completely customizable tooltip on the treemap.

* **Legend** - Use different legend styles to provide information on the treemap data clearly.

* **Selection** - Allows you to select the tiles to highlight it and do any specific functionalities like showing pop-up or navigate to a different page.

* **Custom background widgets** - Add any type of custom widgets such as image widget as a background of the tiles to enrich the UI and easily visualize the type of data that a particular tile shows.
