## SignaturePad `Preview`

The SignaturePad widget allows you to capture smooth and more realistic signatures through drawing gestures. The widget allows you to save the signature as an image, which can be further synchronized with your devices and documents that need the signature.

### Features

* **Signature stroke color customization** - The widget allows you to choose the stroke color for the signature.
* **Signature stroke width customization** - The widget allows you to set the minimum and maximum stroke widths for the signature. 
* **SignaturePad background color customization** - The widget allows you to set the background color for the SignaturePad. 
* **Save as image** - The widget provides option to save the drawn signature as an image. This converted image can be embedded in documents, PDFs, and anything else that supports using images to denote a signature. 
* **More realistic handwritten look and feel** - The unique stroke rendering algorithm draws the signature based on the speed of the drawn gestures along minimum and maximum stroke thicknesses, which brings a more realistic hand-written look and feel to the signature.
