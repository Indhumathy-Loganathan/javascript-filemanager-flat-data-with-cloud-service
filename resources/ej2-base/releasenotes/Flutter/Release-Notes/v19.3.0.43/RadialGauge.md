## Radial Gauge

### Enhancements

* Now, the pointer can be freely dragged in clockwise direction even the start angle is greater than end angle for circular radial gauge. For non-circular radial gauge, the pointers dragged between the start and end angle.
* The [`GaugeRange`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/GaugeRange/GaugeRange.html) will always apply in clockwise direction even the [`startValue`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/GaugeRange/startValue.html) is greater than the [`endValue`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/GaugeRange/endValue.html).
