## Pivot Table

### Bug fixes

- The issue with the pivot table not rendering properly when virtualization is enabled with values at the row axis has now been resolved.

### Features

- `#I428621` - Provided support for specifying the default report name via the [FetchReport](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/pivot-table/tool-bar#fetchreport) event to load its report instead of the current report in the pivot table.
