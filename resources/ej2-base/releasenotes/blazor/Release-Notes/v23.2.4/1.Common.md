### Features

- All Syncfusion Blazor UI components now fully support .NET 8. Our Blazor packages have been specifically crafted for compatibility with .NET 8. The components seamlessly integrate with various interactive render modes, including `Server-Side`, `WebAssembly`, and `Auto (Server & WebAssembly)` rendering. Note that there are a few exceptions with the interactive render mode set to `None`.
