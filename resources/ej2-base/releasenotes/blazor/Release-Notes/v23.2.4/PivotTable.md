## Pivot Table

### Bug fixes

- `#I516955` - When virtualization is enabled in the pivot table, date formatting is not applied to date group fields in the row and column headers, which has now been fixed.
- `#I516956` - When virtualization or paging is enabled, the pivot table does not export all of its data, which has now been fixed.
