## Gantt Chart


### Features

- `#FB16439` - Introduced Multi-taskbar support in resource view Gantt Chart. This feature allows you to visualize multiple tasks assigned to each resource within a row when the records are collapsed.

- Improved the user interface for taskbar resizing and moving actions in the Gantt Chart. Now, when users perform taskbar resizing or dragging, a cloned element is displayed instead of updating the original taskbar element. This cloned element remains visible until the action is completed, providing users with a clear representation of the changes they are making.
