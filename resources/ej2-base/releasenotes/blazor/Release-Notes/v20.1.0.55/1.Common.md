## Common

### Features

- In Blazor Theme Studio, migrated to latest `Dart Sass` version from `Node Sass` to compile our theme files.

### Breaking changes

- The Blazor Theme Studio is using 'Dart Sass' instead of 'Node Sass' from this release, since ['Node Sass' was deprecated](https://github.com/sass/node-sass). If you are generating CSS from Sass files in your end, switch to 'Dart Sass'.
