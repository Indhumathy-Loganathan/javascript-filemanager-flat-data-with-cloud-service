## Pivot Table

### Bug Fixes

- `#I347413` - The grid columns, as well as their settings such as format, header text, text wrap, and so on, can now be configured using `DrillThrough` event in the drill-through pop-up.
- `#I346885` - The tooltip will now display properly even if there are multiple Pivot Tables on the same page.
