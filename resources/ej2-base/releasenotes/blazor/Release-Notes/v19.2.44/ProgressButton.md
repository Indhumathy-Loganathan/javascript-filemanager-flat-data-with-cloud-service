## ProgressButton

### New Features

- Along with adding Async suffix for asynchronous methods, we have changed the name too to meet standard for the following methods.

	|Method | Usage|
	|-----|-----|
	|FocusAsync | Use `FocusAsync` method to focus the component.|
	|EndProgressAsync | Use `EndProgressAsync` method to complete the button progress.|
