- Updated the [CRG](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/crg/) Bundled resources delivery process in which shared the selected components resources download links are shared via mail instead of direct download from application.

### Breaking changes

- The [Built-in JavaScript isolation](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/adding-script-references#javascript-isolation) feature has been marked as deprecated in 2022 Vol1 release, since loading scripts externally provides better performance over JavaScript isolation approach. As of the 2023 Vol1 release, this feature has been removed. If you are still using it, we recommend loading scripts externally via [CDN](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/adding-script-references#cdn-reference) or [Static Web Assets](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/adding-script-references#static-web-assets).
