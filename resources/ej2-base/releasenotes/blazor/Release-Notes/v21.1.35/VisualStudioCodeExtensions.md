## Visual Studio Code Extensions

### New Feature

We've updated the release versioning system to a semantic format which provides greater clarity and consistency in versioning, making it easier for users to understand the significance of each release for our **Syncfusion NuGet packages** and extension utilities such as **Blazor VS-Code project template studio, and  conversion & migration**. This new format consists of three components: Major, Minor, and Patch. We believe that this change will enable our users to track and manage updates to our utilities.
