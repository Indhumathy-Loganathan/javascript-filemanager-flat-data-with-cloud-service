## Dropdown Tree `Preview`

The Dropdown Tree component allows you to select single or multiple values from the hierarchical and self-referential data in a tree-like structure. It has several out-of-the-box features, such as data binding, check boxes, templates, accessibility, and pre-selected values. The available key features are

- **Data binding** - To bind and access a hierarchical and self-referential list of items from a local or server-side data source.

- **Checkbox** - To select more than one item in the Dropdown Tree component without affecting the UI appearance.

- **Multiple selection** - To select more than one item in the component.

- **Filtering** - Enables quick filtering of tree items based on characters entered in the search box. This feature supports both local and remote data sources.

- **Sorting** - To display the Dropdown Tree items in `ascending` or `descending` order.

- **Templates** - To customize the Dropdown Tree items, header, footer, action failure content, and no records content.

- **Accessibility** - To provide access to all the Dropdown Tree component features through keyboard interaction, on-screen readers, and other assistive technology devices.
