## Grid

### Breaking Changes

- The [Selection](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Grids.Action.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Grids_Action_Selection) property in the [Action](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Grids.Action.html) enum class has been marked as deprecated and should no longer be used. It will be removed in a future version.
- The [OnRowDragStart](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Grids.GridEvents-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Grids_GridEvents_1_OnRowDragStart) event and the [RowDragEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Grids.RowDragEventArgs-1.html) class has been marked as deprecated and should no longer be used. It will be removed in a future version. A new event called `RowDragStarting` has been introduced, which is triggered when the rows are dragged to perform reordering. This event uses the `RowDragStartingEventArgs` class as its argument.

**Previous**

```csharp
<SfGrid DataSource="@Orders">
<GridEvents OnRowDragStart="RowDragStartHandler" TValue="Order"></GridEvents>
........
</SfGrid>
@code{
public void RowDragStartHandler(RowDragEventArgs<Order> args)
{    
   //you can get the dragged row data's here
   List<Orders> Data = args.Data;
}
}
```

**Now**

```csharp
   <SfGrid DataSource="@Orders">
    <GridEvents TValue="Orders" RowDragStarting="RowDragStartingHandler"></GridEvents>
    ........
    </SfGrid>
    @code{
    public async Task RowDragStartingHandler(RowDragStartingEventArgs<Orders> args)
    {
        //you can get the dropped row data's here
        List<Orders> Data = args.Data;
    }
    }

```

- The argument class for the [RowDropped](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Grids.GridEvents-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Grids_GridEvents_1_RowDropped) event has been changed from [RowDragEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Grids.RowDragEventArgs-1.html) to `RowDroppedEventArgs`, as the `RowDragEventArgs` class has been marked as deprecated.

**Previous**

```csharp
<SfGrid DataSource="@Orders">
<GridEvents TValue="Orders" RowDropped="RowDroppedHandler"></GridEvents>
........
</SfGrid>
@code{
public async Task RowDroppedHandler(RowDragEventArgs<Order> args)
{
    //you can get the dropped row data's here
     List<Orders> Data = args.Data;
}
}
```

**Now**

```csharp
<SfGrid DataSource="@Orders">
<GridEvents TValue="Orders" RowDropped="RowDroppedHandler"></GridEvents>
........
</SfGrid>
@code{
public async Task RowDroppedHandler(RowDroppedEventArgs<Orders> args)
{
    //you can get the dropped row data's here   
      List<Orders> Data = args.Data;
}
}
```
- The data type for the `FromIndex` and `DropIndex` properties in the `RowDragEventArgs` class has been changed from double to int, as they should be of the integer data type, rather than the double data type.

**Previous**

```csharp
<SfGrid DataSource="@Orders">
<GridEvents OnRowDragStart="RowDragStartHandler" TValue="Order"></GridEvents>
........
</SfGrid>
@code{
public void RowDragStartHandler(RowDragEventArgs<Order> args)
{    
   //you can get the FromIndex and DropIndex here
   double fromIndex = args.FromIndex;
   double dropIndex = args.DropIndex;
}
}
```

**Now**

```csharp
<SfGrid DataSource="@Orders">
<GridEvents OnRowDragStart="RowDragStartHandler" TValue="Order"></GridEvents>
........
</SfGrid>
@code{
public void RowDragStartHandler(RowDragEventArgs<Order> args)
{    
   //you can get the FromIndex and DropIndex here
   int fromIndex = args.FromIndex;
   int dropIndex = args.DropIndex;
}
}
```

- In the past, the dropping action could be cancelled by setting args.Cancel as true in the [RowDropped](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Grids.GridEvents-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Grids_GridEvents_1_RowDropped) event. However, to cancel the row dropping action now, you must set args.Cancel as true in the `RowDropping` event.

**Previous**

```csharp
<SfGrid DataSource="@Orders">
<GridEvents TValue="Orders" RowDropped="RowDroppedHandler"></GridEvents>
........
</SfGrid>
@code{
public async Task RowDroppedHandler(RowDragEventArgs<Order> args)
{
    args.Cancel = true;
}
}
```

**Now**

```csharp
<SfGrid DataSource="@Orders">
<GridEvents TValue="Orders" RowDropping="RowDroppingHandler"></GridEvents>
........
</SfGrid>
@code{
public async Task RowDroppingHandler(RowDroppingEventArgs<Orders> args)
{
    //you can cancel the dropping action here
    args.Cancel = true;
}
}
```
