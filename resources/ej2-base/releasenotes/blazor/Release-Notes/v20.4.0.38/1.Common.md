### Breaking changes

* Syncfusion Blazor components will no longer support `.NET 3.1` as it has reached its [end of support cycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core). We recommend upgrading to `.NET 6` to take advantage of new features and components. If you are unable to update to `.NET 6`, you may continue to use version `20.3` in your `.NET 3.1` projects.

* If you are using Syncfusion Blazor components without first registering a license, a license dialog will appear after a certain limit of usage, preventing further interaction in the app. Please make sure to register a valid license in order to continue using the Syncfusion Blazor components without interruption.
