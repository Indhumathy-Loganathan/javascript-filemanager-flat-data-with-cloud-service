## Pivot Table

### Features

- When virtualization is enabled, a single page mode is introduced, which allows only the current view page to be displayed during virtual scrolling operations, making UI actions in the pivot table two times faster than in earlier versions. It also improves the component's initial rendering when binding large amounts of data.
