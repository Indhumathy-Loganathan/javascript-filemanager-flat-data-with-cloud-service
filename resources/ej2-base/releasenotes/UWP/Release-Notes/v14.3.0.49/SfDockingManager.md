## SfDockingManager `preview`

The `SfDockingManager` control for UWP lets you add Visual Studio style docking windows to your application. The dock panels support many interactions like docking, floating, tabbing, auto-hiding and more.

### Key Features

*   Child panels can be docked to the left, right, top, or bottom sides of the container.
*	Child panels can be dragged interactively around the screen to make them float over any location on the DockingManager client area.
*	Two or more child panels can be docked at the same location using tabs.
*	In the auto hidden option, panels that are not being used automatically collapse into the frame of the container (like the toolbox in Visual Studio) and expand when clicked on the associated tabs.
*	The docking manager also helps to implement document container-like applications in which the child panels can also become child windows. The container is laid out in a Visual Studio-style tabbed layout.
*	An instance of a docking manager can be nested inside a docking window to achieve complex nested layouts.
*	There is built-in capability to save and load complex, user-defined layouts.
*	All static text within the docking manager can be localized to any desired language
