## SfSchedule

### Bug fixes
{:#sfSchedule-bug-fixes}

* \#I370502 - Now, the `Appointment` will render correctly when the wrong resource is added to an appointment, that is, the resource that is not in the scheduler resource collection.
* \#I370228 - The `NullReferenceException` will no longer be thrown in `SfSchedule` in the randomly reproduced windows store application.
