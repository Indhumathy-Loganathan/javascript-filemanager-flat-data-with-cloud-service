### Known issues
{:#sfdatagrid-known-issues}

* Deploying SfDataGrid in Windows Phone 8 Silverlight will not work with Xamarin NuGet greater than 1.5.1.6471 due to cyclic layout calls in the Framework. This is a known issue and has been [reported as a bug](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=36328) in Bugzilla and is being worked by Xamarin. Hence, this version of SfDataGrid does not support Windows Phone 8 Silverlight. In case, if you prefer to run the SfDataGrid with 1.5.1.6471 version of NuGet, please contact our support team to get custom assemblies
