## SfDataGrid

### Bug fixes
{: #sfdatagrid-bug-fixes}

* \#311755 - [UWP] Now, the datagrid renders properly in RTL and programmatic scrolling to 0th index works properly when setting `SfDataGrid.FlowDirection` as RTL.
* \#310535 - Now the stacked headers are rendered properly even when stacked columns are created and added to a `StackedHeaderRow` before the `SfDataGrid.Columns` collection is populated.
