### Bug fixes
{: #sfdatagrid-bug-fixes}

* \#298589 - Now, exception will not be thrown when committing the cell value of a `GridTemplateColumn` when a `Dictionary` typed collection is set as `SfDataGrid.ItemsSource`.
* \#298341 - Now, the color of the text "No Results Found" when opening the `GridComboBoxColumn`'s drop down, is in line with the current applied theme.
