### Bug fixes
{:#sfchart-bug-fixes}

* \#I327662 - [UWP] Now, the `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` will no longer be thrown when selecting the data point after clear and add the series.
* \#I322717 - [UWP] The trackball is now updating properly with the nearest point of the same series instead of moving to the next series while invoking the trackball at NaN values.
