### Breaking Changes

{:#sfnumericupdown-breaking-changes}

* Due to internal architecture change, now, it is not required to add `Syncfusion.SfNumericUpDown.Android.dll`
and `Syncfusion.SfNumericUpDown.iOS.dll` assemblies to your platform specific projects such as Android and iOS in Xamarin.Forms respectively. Hence, you need to remove these two assemblies from your platform specific projects.
