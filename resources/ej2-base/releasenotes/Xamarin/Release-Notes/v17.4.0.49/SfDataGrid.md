### Bug Fixes
{: #sfdatagrid-bug-fixes}

* \#I262988 - Now, the current cell's row index and column index are updated properly when a new row is added in runtime.
* \#263345 - The `NullReferenceException` is no longer thrown when multiple expanded groups are in view and `SfDataGrid.GroupingMode` is set as `GroupingMode.Single` in runtime.
