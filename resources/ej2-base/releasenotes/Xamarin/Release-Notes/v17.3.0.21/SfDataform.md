{:#sfdataform-bug-fixes}

* \#I249964 - Now the `SelectedIndexChanged` event was fired from the `DataFormPicker` editor when using the custom picker editor.
* \#I249980 - Now there is no longer a blank space in DataFormItem's `IsVisible` property which is set to false in `FloatingLabelLayout` when a column count is given.
