## Common

* From this release onwards, the localization procedure for our controls has been simplified to use .resx files to provide localized text in .NET Standard projects. Localized text is no longer required in platform-specific projects. However, if you are already following a platform-specific approach, it will continue to work.
* All the samples have been upgraded to Visual Studio 2017 with .NET Standard.
* Provided macOS support for chart, data grid and list view.
