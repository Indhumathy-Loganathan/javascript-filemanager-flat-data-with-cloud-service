* Deploying SfDataGrid in Windows Phone 8 Silverlight will not work with Xamarin NuGet greater than 1.5.1.6471 due to cyclic layout calls in the Framework. Moreover, [Xamarin has mentioned]( https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/platform-features/windows/) that Windows Phone 8 Silverlight will be deprecated in the near future.
