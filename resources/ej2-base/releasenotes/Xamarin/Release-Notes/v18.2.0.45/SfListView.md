*\#282102 - Now, the `OutOfMemoryException` will no longer be thrown when we Drag/Drop between groups even when `SfListView.DragDropController.UpdateSource` is true.
*\#277135 - [Android] Now, when Horizontal listview is loaded inside a vertical listview, scrolling will work independently and properly for both list view instances.
