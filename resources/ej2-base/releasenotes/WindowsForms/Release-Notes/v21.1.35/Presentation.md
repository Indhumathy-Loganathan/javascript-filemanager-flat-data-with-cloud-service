### Breaking Changes
{:#Presentation-breaking-changes}

* From this release onwards, we no longer ship or support versions compatible with .NET Framework 2.0 and 3.5. Therefore, we strongly recommend upgrading to a higher version of .NET Framework, .NET 6.0 or 7.0. You can find the migration guide if you prefer to [migrate from .NET Framework to .NET Core or .NET 5.0/6.0/7.0](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/faqs/migrate-from-net-framework-to-net-core)
