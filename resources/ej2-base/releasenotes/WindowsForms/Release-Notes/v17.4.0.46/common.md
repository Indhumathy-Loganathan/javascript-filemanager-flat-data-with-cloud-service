### WinForms NetCore Breaking Changes

You can now create NetCore 3.1v WinForms application, using Syncfusion controls. Microsoft has announced breaking changes in WinForms NetCore 3.1 in their [announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/). To align with NetCore 3.1 changes, we have replaced old APIs with corresponding alternates. Please note that this change will not affect our WinForm DotNet framework controls in any way.
