## ImageEditor

### Features

- Provided Support for image annotations, including the ability to insert and display multiple images alongside the main image being edited, is now provided through the annotation button in the toolbar. The [drawImage](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/image-editor#drawimage) method is employed to seamlessly incorporate these additional images into the primary image.

- The addition of frame support allows for the application of decorative borders or frames around images, enhancing their visual appeal. This functionality can be accessed through the toolbar and is complemented by the [drawFrame](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/image-editor#drawframe) method, enabling users to apply various types of frames to their images.

- Resizing support has been introduced, enabling the adjustment of image size and dimensions for diverse purposes like printing or web display. This feature is accessible through the toolbar and is complemented by the [resize](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/image-editor#resize) method, allowing users to modify image dimensions while preserving or disregarding aspect ratios as needed.
