## CircularGauge

### Bug Fixes

- `#I340382` - The script size in the Circular Gauge has been reduced.
- `#I333600` - No script errors are thrown when the same start and end values are set in the range using the `setRangeValue()` method.
- `#I333600` - When the `start` and `end` values of the range are set to the same value, the range's path will be correct now.
