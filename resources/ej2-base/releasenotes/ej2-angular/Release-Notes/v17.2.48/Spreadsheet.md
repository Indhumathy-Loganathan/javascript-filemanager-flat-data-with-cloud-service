## Spreadsheet

The Spreadsheet is an user interactive component to organize and analyse data in tabular format. It will load data by importing an excel file or from a data source, such as array of JSON objects, `OData web services`, or [`DataManager`](http://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/data?utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=spreadsheet) binding to a range. The populated data can be exported as Excel, PDF, and CSV formats.
