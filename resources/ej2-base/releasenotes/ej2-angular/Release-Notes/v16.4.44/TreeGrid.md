## TreeGrid

### Bug Fixes

- `actionBegin`, `actionComplete` and `actionFailure` events are triggered properly.
- Additional parameters that are added using the `query` property of TreeGrid are passed to the server side when a parent record is expanded.
- Expanding and Collapsing records is working fine when `pageSizeMode` is set as `All`.
- `expandAtLevel`, `collapseAtLevel`, `expandAll` and `collapseAll` methods are working fine when `pageSizeMode` is set as `All`.
