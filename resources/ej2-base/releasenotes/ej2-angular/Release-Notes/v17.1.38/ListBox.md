## ListBox

The ListBox is a graphical user interface component used to display a list of items. Users can select one or more items in the list using a checkbox or by keyboard selection. It supports sorting, grouping, reordering, and drag and drop of items. The available key features are:


- **Data binding**: Binds and accesses the list of items from local or server-side data source.
- **Dual ListBox**: Allows transferring and reordering the list item between two ListBoxes.
- **Drag and Drop**: Allows drag and drop the list item with the same/multiple ListBox.
- **Grouping**: Groups the logically related items under a single or specific category.
- **Templates**: Customizes the list items.
- **Sorting**: Sorts the list items in alphabetical order (either ascending or descending).
- **Accessibility**: Provided with built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the ListBox component features using the keyboard, screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.
