## Calendars

### Features

- Event arguments for all Calendar components has been streamlined.

### Breaking Changes

- Newly added `ColorPicker` component in input package requires `SplitButton` dependency, So now it's mandatory to include the `ej2-splitbuttons.umd.min.js` in system.js configuration if your using system.js module loader.
- Update the `system.js` configuration while going with this version and above.
- Today button will act as a primary button in high contrast, bootstrap and fabric themes.
