### Breaking Changes

- From this release, Syncfusion provided the Ivy-compatible support for the Angular packages. Ivy Angular packages support Angular versions 12 and above. While using the latest Angular packages in the Angular 11 and below version application, components will not work. To provide the latest features and fixes for Angular versions 11 and below, Syncfusion will maintain the Angular packages tagged with `ngcc`. To install Angular packages that are compatible with `ngcc` for the Angular versions 11 and below application, run the `npm install @syncfusion/ej2-angular-grids@ngcc` command.
