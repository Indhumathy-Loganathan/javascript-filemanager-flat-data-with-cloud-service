### Features
{:#sfcombobox-features}

* **AutoAppendType** - The ComboBox control provides auto-append support with the selection of text as well as text alone. The auto-append UI can be defined by using the `AutoAppendType` property. There are two types of auto-append UI: The `TextWithSelection` and `Text`. When the auto-append UI is set to `Text`, the appended text appears with a faded foreground, similar to Windows 11 search UI.
