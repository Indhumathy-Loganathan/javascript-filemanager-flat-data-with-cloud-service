## SfCalendarDatePicker

### Bug fixes

- `#I480463` - Now, when the `AllowNull` is set to false, selecting the same date again will properly retain the selected state.
- `#I480463` - The application will no longer crash when a past date is set as the MaxDate, and subsequently selecting and re-selecting the same date.
