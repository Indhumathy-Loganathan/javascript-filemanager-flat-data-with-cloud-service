* **Recurring Events** - Provided the support to schedule recurring appointments to repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

* **Data mapping** - Allows users to bind any business object to the scheduler appointment. This can be done by mapping data object fields to the scheduler appointment fields such as start time, end time, subject, notes, recurrence,and so on.
