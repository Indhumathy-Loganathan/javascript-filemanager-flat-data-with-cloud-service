## StockChart

### Breaking Changes

- By default, the series type and trendline dropdowns have been removed from the stock chart period selector. However, you can still add them to the list upon request or as needed. This modification provides a cleaner interface and reduces clutter in the stock chart period selector.

- By default, the tooltip for the range selector in the stock chart has been removed. Instead, the tooltip will now appear only when you move the slider.

- The print option has been removed from the period selector because it is already available in the export dropdown. This modification provides a cleaner interface and reduces clutter in the stock chart's period selector.

- The font family for stockchart elements such as the title, axis labels, data labels, legend, tooltip, etc., has been changed based on the theme in the 2023 Volume 2 release.
