## Dialog

### Bug Fixes

- Provided an additional `cssClass`, `zIndex`, `open` and `close` event properties to dialog utility.
- Enable/ Disable the dialog button issue in dynamic way has been fixed.
- Return type of Dialog Utility method has been changed from `DialogModal` to `Dialog` This changes doesn't lead to breaking changes in application level since these two classes are implicitly convertible.
