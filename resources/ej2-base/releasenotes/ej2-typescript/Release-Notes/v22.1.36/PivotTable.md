## Pivot Table

### Bug Fixes

- `#I473176` - The issue with the spinner not being properly hidden on the pivot table when the drillthrough popup was closed with server-side engine has now been resolved.
- `#I461804` - When we bind fields from the same hierarchy, drill down/up will now work properly in the pivot table with an OLAP data.
